I've spent the first part of my work life jumping from one menial job to the next. Over the years, I've unknowingly been seeking out more different jobs that didn't require an education. Honestly I was prepared to continue living my life scrapping by without ever accomplishing anything that I could take pride in. Two and a half years ago I met the woman that would become my wife. Since then I have been striving to do and be better. I was tired of just surviving and decided to actually start building a life for myself and the family that I was creating. I came to the conclusion that I would never be better if I didn't better myself, so I set out to find an actual career that would be a good fit for me. I discovered several coding programs, but App Academy offered one of the longest programs and was NOT FREE. I'm a realist and understand that my future will take a big investment on my part. I am and will continue making that investment to achieve the accomplishment I can take pride in, and to provide a better future for the ones I care about.
